# Dynamic Layered Audio in StepMania

This is a proof-of-concept of a Lua-controlled multitrack audio system for
minigame use in StepMania.

This video demonstrates how moving the character avatar closer to — and further
away from — each piano changes how loudly its audio plays.

### How to use

The relevant code is in `dynamic-audio.lua` — it's super-hardcoded and not
generalized enough to be useful, but that's a proof-of-concept for you. :^)

If you're interested in learning more about how you might use something like
this, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/quietly-turning/dynamic-layered-audio-demo/issues) 
and I can probably be convinved to clean it up a little.
